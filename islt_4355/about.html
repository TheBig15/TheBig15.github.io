    <h3>Hello, I am Del. My name is a shortened version of my grandfather’s middle name, Delano. He was named after Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</h3> 
        <p> Presently, I am 31 years old and live in the small town of West Plains, Missouri. I work at Hardee’s making food, mostly. I have no web application or development training experience.
            <br /> I expect to learn how to design my own website. I hope to build a website with a self-improvement theme. I enjoy exercising, tennis, videogames, movies, reading, and playing with my 7 y/o daughter, <strong>Daisy</strong>. Regarding videogames, my favorites include Just Dance (Wii), Mario Party (Wii), Guitar Hero (Xbox 360), Resident Evil 4 (GameCube), and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (N64). Pertaining to movies, I love all of Disney’s classics, Raya and the Last Dragon, Frozen I & II, Kung Fu Panda, Ninja Turtles, The Matrix, <em>John Wick</em>, The Hateful 8, and Logan. </p>
