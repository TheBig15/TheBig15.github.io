    <h3>The Year of the Interviews (2020)</h3>
    <p> I was interviewed for the suicide prevention organizer 
        with the Community Partnership of the Ozarks (CPO) organization; the interview was 
        conducted via zoom. This was my first virtual interview where I experienced what that 
        felt like and how to communicate my strengths and skills through the computer’s 
        Webcam. Another interview took place with Ozarks Medical Center (OMC, renamed Ozarks 
        Healthcare). I attended two interviews; the initial interview and the follow up interview. I 
        learned how to express my organization skills and deliver quality interpersonal skills to the
        interviewers for the position of a social worker. My next interview was with Three Rivers Hospice
        for the position of an outreach specialist. In the interview, I learned about the position, what 
        kind of negotiation skills are needed, and the amount of travel required. It was a pleasant 
        professional in-person experience. Although I did not end up being hired for any of these 
        positions due to my lack of experience in the medical field, I have learned how to connect 
        with professionals better through open and honest communication.
 <br /> Soon after this, I decided to reassess my career goals and began searching for a position that
        I was truly passionate for. Additionally, I discovered that I was still hungry to learn more
        and started conducting research on graduate school programs. It was through my curiosity to
        learn that I revealed my enthusiasm for teaching.

    <h3>Retail Associate Experience</h3>
<p class="indent"> I worked at Hibbett Sports in West Plains, Missouri for five years 
        from 2016 to 2021. I specialized in customer service, store organization, and managerial 
        operations. Practicing interpersonal communication in that department becomes a way of life. 
        Eventually, I got comfortable with conflict management and conflict resolution between 
        employees and customers which is inevitable in any business. These top two skills are imperative 
        to practice as a retail associate. Through working at the sports store, I amassed great knowledge 
        about sports shoes. Depending on the customer’s height, weight, and occupation, I could deliver 
        the product best suited to his or her needs. Throughout the years I worked there, my boss 
        continued to complement the quality of my customer service. At the end of those years, I parted
        ways with the sports store because I wanted to become actively involved in education.

    <h3>Two Years of Manual Labor</h3>
<p class="indent"> From 2014 to 2016, I worked at the West Plains Country 
        Club doing golf course maintenance. During this job, I raked the bunkers, line trimmed, mowed 
        the rough, and mowed tees and approaches. This gave me experience handling moderate to 
        heavy machinery. In addition, I participated in landscaping such as elevating a tee mound and 
        cutting down trees. This work experience provided me with a disciplined routine of waking up 
        early and the physical demands conditioned my body. However, my career aspirations inevitably
        guided me toward an occupation with more upward mobility.
    </p>
    <h3>Becoming a Professor</h3>
<p class="indent"> If there are two things in life that I know with utmost certainty, they are 
        that I love to learn and I love to teach. As if participating in graduate school was not enough, I 
        have a habit of looking for lessons wherever I go. My passion for learning reflects the continuing 
        goal of improving my knowledge base in a highly competitive world where learning is the new 
        currency. Throughout my experience as a substitute teacher and, especially, as a father, teaching 
        is a way of life that I cannot get enough of. I want to influence the educational world for the 
        better. I want a diverse foundational experience in the K-12 setting. Ultimately, I want to 
        discover how to teach self-improvement as a professor at a university. However, I realize that I 
        have much more to study and a lot more work experience to accrue in education before this can 
        be actualized. Although this would likely be perceived as daunting to most, the challenge of self-
        improvement encourages me because we all have a personal journey with it. In conclusion, I 
        believe the more we strive to understand each other, the closer we come to attaining it.
