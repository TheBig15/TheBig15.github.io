<h2> Del Quentin Bowles </h2>
<h3> Hello and welcome! The purpose of my website is to show you my skills, elicit my
    qualifications, share my work history, and convey my professional path.</h3>

<blockquote> "The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows."
    <em>-Syndney J. Harris</em></blockquote>
<main><p> A prominent goal of this website is to provide the viewer with my impressionable qualities. The
    main objective is to communicate my relevant experiences, insightful college projects, CV/Resume and
    contact information should the user wish to reach me. Each of my activities will be accompanied by
    engaging visuals such as pictures and videos.
<br /> Before I began working for Hardee's as the cook this summer, I was a substitute teacher at
Richards R-V School. Even though I am enjoying my job at Hardee's, I intend to become a local
substitute teacher in the fall. My aim is to diversify my work experience in the field of education. Then, after
acquiring my Master's of Science, I plan on working at the Missouri State University-West Plains. My dream
job is to, one day, become a <em> College Professor </em> that teaches <strong> self-improvement</strong>.
<br /> Although this is my professional website, I hope the experience leaves you entertained.
